- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @just-a-few-code-lines

Senior SW engineer based in Nantes, France. From the Atari demo scene to nowadays, I learnt many languages and technics. Design and optimization specialist.

This github account is just for fun, and will only expose personal works. No assembly language, perhaps a few C/C++ files, surely js and php hacks and tools...
